## Introduction

Understanding word meanings can be approached through two main methods: lexical semantics and vector semantics. Lexical semantics involves analyzing words based on their definitions, relationships, and usage patterns, often through manual analysis by linguists. On the other hand, vector semantics relies on large datasets to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similarity is determined by their distributional properties. In this work, we aim to evaluate the correlation between these two approaches.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

After installing the libraries, clone the GitHub repository and run the main.py file.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BatMrE/Vector-vs-Lexical-semantics.git
cd Vector-vs-Lexical-semantics
python main.py
```

## Overview and Results
For detailed code results and graphs, refer to the notebook file. Note that to run the [notebook]("https://github.com/BatMrE/Vector-vs-Lexical-semantics/blob/main/Vector_vs_Lexical.ipynb"), you may need to update paths and relevant files, and comment out model saving and loading cells
